- Is \ continuation in strings is parsed correctly?

* I'll need to sort them again.  Why not just pay no mind to sorting except to
  a full sort as the last step?  I think 100k elements should sort quickly.
  . Time old and new versions against ghc source.
  . Do emacs tags need to be sorted?  Apparently not.

* I get scrambled warning output, probably due to threads not locking the
output.

/ Lots of parse errors on ghc source.
  . Looks like it's just weird primitive syntax like data (a, b) = (a, b).

* Implement --qualified flag.
  . The only reason to have static is that the same name is prioritized if
    local.  But with qualified names, none are local.  No wait, I still have
    all the unqualified ones for local jumping.  But vim already knows the
    filename, so won't it already prioritize that?  Yes, it will.
  . Verify that local definitions get priority.  They do.
  * Write vim binding to bind to ^] and expand to keyword + '.', without
    having to modify iskeyword.
    . Problems with adding '.' to iskeyword:
      . 'w' is unexpected, so I'm surprised when cw deletes past the '.'.
      . * and # also include the qualification, which means I can't check
        spelling with * and search highlighting.  It also breaks my habit of
        finding a definition by doing *, switching to its file, then n.  But
        maybe I should be using tags for that!

* Option to collapse different typed tags on the same line.  Didn't I add
something like this long ago?
  - I think I can get rid of RepeatedTag now, but I should probably implement
    merging for emacs tags.

- Would it make a difference to use Vector for tags instead of lists?
